Plumes of dust rise up and glitter in the sunlight and you make the books purr by flipping the pages through your excited palms, smelling the sweetness of old ink and sneezing when you breathe in too hard. We’re making a mess so I neatly replace each book and follow you back onto the sidewalk. It smells like hot coffee and grease from the breakfast place down the street. A bus hits a puddle, sending a plume of water onto our toes and I forget to be mad because you laugh and splash it back."
